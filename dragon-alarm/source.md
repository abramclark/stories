# Illustrations

## Strategy

I Initially started with the entire story in context, and the results were terrible. I created a new session with this prompt:

"""Draw a children's story cover with the title + subtitle of:
The Dragon Alarm That Cried Whoosh,
The False Positive Paradox"""

This was decent but showed only one dragon and nothing about the underlying "moral" of the story. I decided to be explicit about how I wanted the art and moved to:

"""Nice, but let's try again. A cover containing the title and subtitle: The Dragon Alarm That Cried Whoosh, The False Positive Paradox And containing a super-position of dragons, meaning multiple dragons with fuzziness demonstrating it is unclear which, if any, dragon is real."""

Ultimately I started a new session for all the illustrations when a new prompt happened to produce an artistic style I much preferred. I then generated the rest of the illustrations in the same session so I could make references to characters, scenes, and objects. I went back to the cover, to get a more consistent oil paint style instead of the original cartoon.
