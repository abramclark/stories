## Cover Prompt Strategy

Initially started with entire story in context, and the results were terrible. I created a
new session with this prompt:

Draw a children's story cover with the title + subtitle of:
The Dragon Alarm That Cried Whoosh,
The False Positive Paradox

This was decent but showed only one dragon and nothing about the underlying "moral" of the
story. I decided to be explicit about how I wanted the art and moved to:

Nice, but let's try again. A cover containing the title and subtitle: The Dragon Alarm That Cried Whoosh, The False Positive Paradox And containing a super-position of dragons, meaning multiple dragons with fuzziness demonstrating it is unclear which, if any, dragon is real.
