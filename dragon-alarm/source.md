# Cover prompt

## Current Version

Draw a children's story cover with the title + subtitle of:
The Dragon Alarm That Cried Whoosh,
The False Positive Paradox

## Concepts

Try adding "with picture of a super-position of dragons in the background."
Or whatever prompt works to convey a sort of visual pun with schrodinger's cat, and the
underlying bayesian nature of this story
